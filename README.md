# go-proxy-gate
This utility acts as a anonymous proxy layer between your machine(s) and destination addresses. 
It shifts every request with different IP address and UA headers, so the destination server cannot recognize your requests as the same. 
This prevents your requests from being blocked with web scraping protection utility.
